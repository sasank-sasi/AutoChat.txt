## Automated Pipeline Usage Instructions

### **Run the Entire Pipeline**
To scrape data, preprocess it, and prepare it for chatbot integration in one go, execute the following command:
```bash
python pipeline.py
```
- This command will sequentially:
  1. Scrape data from the provided website link.
  2. Preprocess the scraped data.
  3. Prepare the data for use by the chatbot.

**Note:** You will be prompted to input the URL of the website you wish to scrape.

Once the data pipeline is complete, you can start the chatbot by running:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```
The chatbot uses **Groq** as the backend to process queries and respond effectively.

### **Run Components Individually**
If you prefer to run each step independently, execute the following commands in sequence:

1. **Scrape data from a website:**
   ```bash
   python scrapper.py
   ```
   Enter the URL of the website when prompted.

2. **Preprocess the scraped data:**
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Prepare the chatbot dataset:**
   ```bash
   python chatbot_data.py
   ```

Finally, launch the chatbot:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

This approach allows more control over individual stages of the process.
